  <h1>HI</h1>
  <p>HI everyone, idk how to code yet but am very ready to learn everything there is to know about it.</p>
  <p>So far, i can make a simple web page but even after trying to search for it online i didn't find it....i must have left something out XD</p>
  <h2>GOODBYE</h2>
  <p>This is the current limit of my coding prowess but am sure with proper guidance and exertion from my part I'll become the biggest pro there is around.</p>
  <p>Until then my dear reader, until then.</p>
  <p>This has been HI and now sadly, due to my inexperience, time has come to say GOODBYE.....this reminds me of aloha XD</p>
